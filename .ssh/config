  # Disable strict hostkey checking. The implications of this are:
  #   1. No more typing 'yes' the first time you connect to a host to accept
  #      its host key and add it to your known_hosts
  #   2. When SSH detects that a hostkey has changed, it will still log you in,
  #      but you'll see the standard big ugly warning and agent forwarding will
  #      be disabled, so that, if the machine is compromised, an attacker can't
  #      piggyback onto your forwarded agent.
